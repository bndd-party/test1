My creative hideout is finally here! 🎉  
In this post, I’d like to look back on my blogging journey  
and share why I decided to build my new site with Astro.

I’ve also included a few nostalgic photos from my older blogs —  
I hope you enjoy them!

## My Blogging Journey  

Over the years, I’ve tried a few different blogging platforms.

My very first blog was a simple doll blog.  
It was easy to use and perfect for casually sharing my thoughts and photos.

Looking back at those old images now makes me smile —  
even though my skills were still developing,  
I was clearly having a lot of fun.

## My WordPress Era

Next, I moved to WordPress for a figure-focused blog.

WordPress is powerful and flexible,  
but for me, it started to feel… overwhelming.

Too many plugins, too many settings,  
and too many things to think about 😅

I realized I was spending more time managing the site  
than actually enjoying my hobby.

## And Then… Astro 🚀

I had always been interested in static websites.

They’re fast, secure, and simple —  
and that simplicity really appealed to me.

I didn’t want a place to *manage*.  
I wanted a place to *display* my creations.

Plastic models, figures, dolls,  
things I’ve built, things I’ve photographed —  
I just wanted to line them up nicely and enjoy them.

That’s how I found Astro.

This time, I avoided themes and built everything myself.  
I wanted to understand my site’s structure from the inside out.

And honestly?  
It feels peaceful.

Now I know how everything works,  
so I’m not afraid to tweak, expand, or experiment in the future.

It’s like building your own PC —  
once you understand the parts,  
you feel much more comfortable using and upgrading it.

I finally feel like I’ve created a quiet, personal space  
just for my creativity.

🧑‍🚀🚀  
Off to the stars!
