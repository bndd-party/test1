## Why I built a new PC

Until recently, I was using a gaming laptop I bought back in 2020.  
It still worked, but newer software was getting heavier and heavier.

The final blow was a game that required **85 GB** of storage.

My laptop became extremely hot while running it,  
and a few days later, the battery started swelling and pushing up the keyboard.

At that point, I thought:  
…Okay, this is scary 😅

I replaced the battery, but it made me realize  
that if I wanted to enjoy games, modeling, and photo editing comfortably,  
it was time to move to a desktop PC.

## A PC case that became a photo studio

Once my new PC was finished,  
I noticed something unexpected.

The inside of the case was glowing with RGB lights —  
almost like a tiny futuristic stage.

So I thought:  
Why not try using it as a photo background?

The case I chose is the **MSI MAG PANO 100R PZ WHITE**.  
Honestly, I picked it mainly because my graphics card would fit  
and the price was reasonable.

But once I saw the lights inside,  
I couldn’t resist putting a model in there.

It turned into a nice near-future scene —  
almost like a small sci-fi set.

## A new partner for my hobbies

Thanks to the new PC,  
my apps now run smoothly and comfortably.

For someone who loves:

- building models  
- collecting figures  
- taking photos  

this machine feels like a perfect new partner.

And I didn’t expect my PC case  
to double as a miniature photo studio —  
but that made the whole experience even more fun 😊
