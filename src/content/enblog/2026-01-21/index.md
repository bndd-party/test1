## Hello, My Blog! 🎂

For me, a blog is like a **secret hideout**.

This is a hobby blog about building plastic models,  
taking photos of figures and dolls,  
and sometimes struggling along the way.

I wanted a place to keep my memories  
and share the joy of creating.

There may be some rough edges here and there,  
but I hope you enjoy your time here!

## Why a blog?

After building this site, I realized again  
how much I love blogging.

That feeling stayed with me over the years.

<br>

Back when I used to run a blog,  
someone once told me:

> “Your writing is really fun. I feel like we’d get along well!”

Of course, it’s nice to hear “Your photos are beautiful,”  
but knowing that someone connected with my words  
meant even more to me.

That’s why I keep writing —  
hoping to quietly connect with someone out there,  
somewhere in the vast ocean of the internet.

## About this blog

Here, I’ll mainly share:

- Plastic models  
- Figures  
- Dolls  

and the **things I make and the photos I take**.

Not just finished results, but also:

- My trial and error  
- Things that didn’t go well  
- Moments when I simply thought, “I love this”  

I want this to be a relaxed place to leave those memories.

I enjoy every part of the process —  
building, imagining, painting, and taking photos.

If I can share even a little of that joy,  
I’d be very happy.
