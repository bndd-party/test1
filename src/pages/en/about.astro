    <p class="lead">
      Kit Connect is a personal blog about figure and model making, painting, and doll photography.

    <p>
      Rather than focusing only on finished works,  
      this site also shares the creative process — including experiments, mistakes, and small discoveries along the way.
    </p>

    <p>
      I enjoy building and painting models as a personal hobby.  
      This site was created to document the process, not just the final results.
    </p>

    <p>
      If it inspires or encourages others who enjoy creative hobbies,  
      I would be very happy.
